# CoreWriterLib

A lightweight helper library that makes it trivial to perform CoreWriter actions and bridge assets between HyperEVM and Core, while handling common foot‑guns:

- Converts **EVM decimals ⇄ HyperCore's “wei” decimals** using `HLConversions`
- Computes **system addresses** for spot/bridging
- Performs **sanity checks** (e.g., zero‑amount after conversion, vault lock checks, self‑transfer guards)


## Usage

### Import
```solidity
import {CoreWriterLib} from "@hyper-evm-lib/src/CoreWriterLib.sol";
```
### Sample usage
```solidity
/// @notice Bridges tokens to core and then sends them to another address
function bridgeToCoreAndSend(address tokenAddress, uint256 evmAmount, address recipient) external payable {

    // use CoreWriterLib to bridge tokens
    CoreWriterLib.bridgeToCore(tokenAddress, evmAmount);

    // Convert EVM amount to wei amount (used in HyperCore)
    uint64 coreAmount = HLConversions.evmToWei(tokenId, evmAmount);

    // use CoreWriterLib to call the spotSend CoreWriter action
    CoreWriterLib.spotSend(recipient, tokenId, coreAmount);
}
```
