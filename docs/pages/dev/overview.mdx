# Overview

## Key Components

### CoreWriterLib

Includes functions to call `CoreWriter` actions, and also has helpers to:

* Bridge tokens to/from Core
* Convert spot token amount representation between EVM and Core (wei) decimals'

Check out the [CoreWriterLib](/dev/corewriter) documentation for more details.

### PrecompileLib

Includes functionality to query the native read precompiles. 

PrecompileLib includes additional functions to query data using EVM token addresses, removing the need to store or pass in the token/spot index. 

Check out the [PrecompileLib](/dev/precompiles) documentation for more details.

### TokenRegistry

Precompiles like `spotBalance`, `spotPx` and more, all require either a token index (for `spotBalance`) or a spot market index (for `spotPx`) as an input parameter.

Natively, there is no way to derive the token index given a token's contract address, requiring projects to store it manually, or pass it in as a parameter whenever needed.

[TokenRegistry](https://github.com/hyperliquid-dev/hyper-evm-lib/blob/main/src/registry/TokenRegistry.sol) solves this by providing a deployed-onchain mapping from EVM contract addresses to their HyperCore token indices, populated trustlessly using precompile lookups for each index.

Check out the [TokenRegistry](/dev/token-registry) documentation for more details.
