title: Testing Framework
---

The testing framework simulates HyperCore interactions so you can test end-to-end flows:

- Full bridging flows between EVM and HyperCore
- Test CoreWriter actions
- Read updated precompile data after CoreWriter actions

### Why it's needed

Testing CoreWriter actions and their state changes is not possible today. This framework makes it possible by simulating HyperCore state. After a CoreWriter action, it updates precompile data so tests can read the new values right away. It also works with forked tests that start from the current state, the simulator updates the state from that point. 





## Example

```solidity
// Pseudocode
setUpHyperCoreHarness();

address usdc = deployTestToken(6);
address user = address(0xBEEF);

// Simulate bridging to Core
uint256 coreAmount = PrecompileLib.convertEvmToCoreAmount(usdc, 1_000_000);
CoreWriterLib.bridgeToCore(usdc, coreAmount, user);

// Validate Core state via precompiles
uint256 bal = PrecompileLib.spotBalanceByAddress(usdc, user);
assert(bal == coreAmount);
```

Refer to repository tests for full harness utilities and fixtures.
