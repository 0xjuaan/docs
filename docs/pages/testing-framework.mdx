title: Testing Framework
---

The testing framework simulates HyperCore interactions so you can test end-to-end flows:

- Bridging between EVM and Core
- CoreWriter actions
- Precompile reads

## Why it helps

It removes uncertainty by letting you validate business logic across both environments locally.

## Example

```solidity
// Pseudocode
setUpHyperCoreHarness();

address usdc = deployTestToken(6);
address user = address(0xBEEF);

// Simulate bridging to Core
uint256 coreAmount = PrecompileLib.convertEvmToCoreAmount(usdc, 1_000_000);
CoreWriterLib.bridgeToCore(usdc, coreAmount, user);

// Validate Core state via precompiles
uint256 bal = PrecompileLib.spotBalanceByAddress(usdc, user);
assert(bal == coreAmount);
```

Refer to repository tests for full harness utilities and fixtures.
