title: Security Considerations
---

Keep these considerations in mind when integrating hyper-evm-lib:

- bridgeToEvm for non-HYPE tokens requires holding HYPE on HyperCore for gas; otherwise `spotSend` fails.
- `convertEvmToCoreAmount` can lose precision when EVM decimals exceed Core decimals (integer downscaling).
- Deploy contracts with complete bridging flows to avoid stuck assets on Core.
  - For example, implementing `bridgeToCore` without `bridgeToEvm` can trap assets.
- Precompile reads return beginning-of-block state. CoreWriter actions affect the next call.

Adopt least privilege, validate inputs, and prefer pull patterns for withdrawals.
