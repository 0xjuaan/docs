# CoreWriterLib

A lightweight helper library that makes it trivial to call **CoreWriter** actions, while handling common foot‑guns:

- Converts **EVM decimals ⇄ HyperCore's “wei” decimals** using `HLConversions`
- Computes **system addresses** for spot/bridging
- Performs **sanity checks** (e.g., zero‑amount after conversion, vault lock checks, self‑transfer guards)


## Install & import

```solidity
import {CoreWriterLib} from "@hyper-evm-lib/src/CoreWriterLib.sol";
